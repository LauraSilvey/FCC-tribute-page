        <p>At the age of 22 with $40 in his pocket, Walt Disney (December 5, 1901 - December 15, 1966) set out from Missouri to Hollywood, California to start an animation stuido with his brother Roy.  It wasn't long before the studio began to see success with their first distribution deal only a few months later.  However, the new found success was not long followed by an upsetting failure, when Walt lost the trademark to the beloved Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in a bitter negotiation battle with Universal Pictures.</p>

        <p>Of course, Walt didn't let failures or discouraging words from others stop him from realizing his dreams.  Walt got straight to work developing a new cartoon character based on a mouse.  By the early 1930's, Mickey Mouse became the world's most popular animated character.   After the success of Mickey Mouse, Walt was eager to enter the feature-length film industry with an animated version of <em>Snow White</em>.  When the film industry learned of Walt's plans, they were convinced that the film would tank and take the whole studio down with it.  On December 21, 1937 <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em> premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater and went on to be the most successful motion picture in 1938.</p>

        <p>The success of <em>Snow White</em> paved the way for the 'Golden Age of Animation', the expansion of Walt Disney Studios and eventually opening one of the world's first theme parks, Disneyland.  Today, children and the young at heart every where continue to enjoy the entertainment empire that Walt Disney built.</p>
